<p>Today is gonna be problems again. Am not really sure if I shall be learning any new concept but least assured I shall solve a few problems, atleast more than yesterday.</p>

<p>I also wanted to experiment with how to Sphere Engine Plugin works for Websites, but then found it to be too much work and I just skipped it.</p>

<p>The First probem I solved was ABSYS from SPOJ which can be classified as a beginner level problem as all you had to do was parse strings to integers and do a required summation or subtraction as required.
The Second problem Stamps also from SPOJ was also an beginner level problem with just sorting to get it done.</p>

<p>The third problem was Street Parade from SPOJ. A question based on stacks, it was pretty straight forward and could be handled easily if all the cases were kept at check.  I would rate it easy but it was honestly one beautiful problem.</p>

<p>That was all I did today, yes. I waste a lot of time. But you mgiht have also noticed that there was a lot of lazy writing involved because of on off plans for a movie that were made along ith this. :P</p>

<p>Ultimately, we never went. <b>I promise that my subsequent blog posts shall be a more detailed one and not as boring as this one. Thanks for sticking along though!</b></p>
