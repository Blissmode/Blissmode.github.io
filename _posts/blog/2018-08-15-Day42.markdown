    table,tr,td,th{
        border:1px solid black;

I started yet again with Dynamic programming, but this time to mark the end of me learning this widely used irritating algorithm paradigm. Irritating unless you find the approach that is.

So I planned to complete four basic problems in 1D DP today but I highly doubt I shall be successful because its already 8 pm now and I have solved just one.

That one problem was a basic longest increasing subsequence problem where the where the starting point and ending point was to be given.
