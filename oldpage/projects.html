                I had worked on implementing the A-star algorithm for finding a valid point between a given starting point and a destination point. This required me to work with OpenCV and to have
                a proper understanding of Graph based algorithms. The code for the same along with its proper documentation is available on Github. <a href="https://github.com/Blissmode/AGV_Task">link for the same</a>.

                I was a part of the Autonomous section of Winter Workshop conducted by Technology Robotix Society, IIT Kharagpur. <br>
                In this we had to create a Self balancing robot which had to balance itself just by using two wheels. My contribution for the same was to design and test the PID controller
                which is the core component of code to balance the robot. The code for the same is available on Github. <a href="https://github.com/Blissmode/self-balancing-robot">link for the same</a>.

                For the event conducted by Technology Robotix Society IIT Kharagpur, I had created a robot which traversed on line following mechanism and was capable of sorting a pattern of blocks using 
                color detection methods. The bot was completely designed by me apart from the supporting chassis the pic for the same is to the right.
